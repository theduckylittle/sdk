# 2.6.0

The v2.6.0 release replaces redux-thunk with redux-saga, and fixes a few bugs:

## Bug fixes

 * Check for layer source in legend code (#922)
 * Fix min/max zoom handling on layers (#924)
 * Fix getArea measurement (#927)

### Upgrade notes

#### redux-thunk has been replaced with redux-saga
If you were using the setContext map action, before, you needed to have your store setup with the redux-thunk middleware:

```
import thunkMiddleware from 'redux-thunk';

const store = createStore(combineReducers({
  map: SdkMapReducer,
}), window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__(),
  applyMiddleware(thunkMiddleware)
);

store.dispatch(mapActions.setContext({url: './bookmarks.json'}));
```

In the new situation, this code needs to be replaced with:

```
import createSagaMiddleware from 'redux-saga';
import * as ContextSagas from '@boundlessgeo/sdk/sagas/context';

const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware();

const store = createStore(combineReducers({
  map: SdkMapReducer,
}), window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__(),
  applyMiddleware(sagaMiddleware)
);

sagaMiddleware.run(ContextSagas.handleContext);

store.dispatch(mapActions.fetchContext({url: './bookmarks.json'}));
```

Also note that the action has been renamed to fetchContext from setContext.
